###Game Summary: 
<em>Survival: Island Escape</em> is a text adventure game in which a player wakes up on a suspicious island and has to find a way of escape before the timer runs out. The player receives initial instructions on two different methods of escape, including gathering materials to build a boat or obtaining a flare gun to signal for help. The player will encounter unique challenges along the way, such as a riddle and a threat that can potentially change the outcome of the game. If the player does not beat the timer by finding a way off the island, they will be doomed to stay forever.
