# Survival: Island Escape


A text-based adventure involving a survivor who wakes up washed on the shore after a horrific boat crash where everyone on board perished except them.
It is a project in Java that pushes the player to get off the island and survive a variety of events.


You are startled awake by the sensation of water crashing on your feet. You look around confused and realize you are no longer in your warm, comfy bed but on a strange island in the middle of nowhere. 

You reach into your pocket to see if you have your cellphone and find a note that reads:

“Hello there. I know you’re wondering where you are. That’s not very important. What is important is how you choose to leave this place. You have two options: search the island for the materials needed to build a boat to help you sail away or search for a safe that will contain a flare gun to signal help. Beware though, each option comes with it’s own challenges. 

P.S. Timing is very important. You are only allotted a certain amount of time to escape or you will be stuck here forever. Happy Escaping!”
